In order to compile and run our program, simply download the zip file and unzip it so that it is a folder.  Once you have done that, it is very important that the images are in the same folder as the programs in order to allow the programs to use the images.  So with everything in the same folder, use the terminal to navigate to the title of the folder which is PeytonandNicoPrototype.  Once you are there, use javac *.java & java Main to run the program.  We will add comprehensive directions this week, but in the mean time if you click on the left of the image/area, it will take you to that areas left neighbor and if you click on the right of the image that will take you to the areas right neighbor.  Currently these hitboxes are both around 10% of the screen, so it is rather far to the right and left.  We have implemented what we will use for puzzles in the future, so when you are in the conference room, click on the computer/little screen on the table.  This will bring you closer to a computer.  In the future, this computer will have some sort of puzzle that the user will have to solve.  Once looking at this computer click the bottom of the screen in order to get back to the room you were just in.  Now go to the room that is the kitchen.  Click on the flowers, a flower icon should now appear in your inventory.  We will use different images in the future, but for now we have implemented this version of our escape room game in order to provide us with a platform upon which we can build our game using different images in the future.  We think that most of our code is such that it should be fairly straightforward to create different implementations in the future.
